# ShortURL

A quick and easy tool to shorten your links. Simply paste a URL, get a shorter version, and share it anywhere.

## Overview

ShortURL makes sharing links easier by turning long URLs into short, clean ones. It’s built using a custom API I developed, which ensures fast and reliable link shortening. Whether you're sharing on social media, in emails, or just want a tidy link, it’s a hassle-free way to shorten URLs.
Check out the API [here](https://github.com/chideraemmanuel/mini-url-api).
